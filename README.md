# About Me - John Haugabook
Currently I'm learning to program and about open source software, while making minor contributions here and there (_previously as_ [@nobedee](https://github.com/nobedee)). Recently I started using this profile after creating an organization profile ([@isocialPractice](https://github.com/isocialPractice)) 
for the website I'm using to learn programming. I feel I'm at an intermediate level now, and looking to start contributing more to the open source. In a few years start making my own projects.

### _Side Note_
To be honest - I'm kinda playing this whole GitHub thing by ear. For open source contributions I'm going to start using this profile (_unless minor typo and/or to avoid clutter, will use_ [@nobedee](https://github.com/nobedee)). 
For future open source projects I'll probably create an organization profile, then fork the repos here. Either way, in a future when I'm comforatble using GitHub, will definitely remove this paragraph.

## Current Project - [practicing.xyz](https://practicing.xyz)
The site [practicing.xyz](https://practicing.xyz) started out as taking notes while learning to code (_now I call it programming_). May main goal then (_and now_) was to learn to make WordPress themes.
It grew, then the website came. Over time I found it was useful to reference, so I started sharing it. Then learned more about the open source; became more interested in contributing; learned I needed to learn GitHub; 
and now here I am - posting repos on GitHub. Hopefully posting repos others find useful as a learning/reference tool.

But the heart of the site is this - it is a dummy site; not a real project. I plan to make open source stuff and contribute more (_if they'll have me_) in the future. While doing so I will probably keep the site updated with snippets and reference documents. 
The gitHub repositories on [@isocialPractice](https://github.com/isocialPractice) are like the site; a learning resource.
