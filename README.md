# About Me - John Haugabook
Currently I'm learning to program and about open source software, while making minor contributions here and there (_previously as_ [@nobedee](https://github.com/nobedee)). Recently I started using this profile after creating an organization profile ([@isocialPractice](https://github.com/isocialPractice)) 
for the website I'm using to learn programming. I feel I'm at an intermediate level now, and looking to start contributing more to the open source. In a few years start making my own projects.

## Current Project - practicing.xyz
The site _practicing.xyz_ started out as taking notes while learning to code (_now I call it programming_). May main goal then (_and now_) was to learn to make WordPress themes.
It grew, then the website came. Over time I found it was useful to reference, so I started sharing it. Then learned more about the open source; became more interested in contributing; learned I needed to learn GitHub; 
and now here I am - posting repos on GitHub.
